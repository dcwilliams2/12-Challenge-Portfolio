# Online Portfolio

## Description

This project is a personal online portfolio created to showcase my skills, projects, and professional achievements. I wanted to create a space where potential employers and collaborators can learn about my expertise and work in an engaging and visually appealing way. This project was built to highlight my abilities in web development, design, and problem-solving. It provides a centralized platform for sharing my resume, portfolio projects, and contact information with ease. Throughout this project, I expanded my knowledge of React, Bootstrap, responsive design, and deployment using Netlify.
